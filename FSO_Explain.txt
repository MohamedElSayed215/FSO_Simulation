Transmitter Side:
----------------
1. PRBS Generator (Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence Generator):
Generates a random sequence of binary bits to simulate the input data signal for testing purposes.

2. NRZ Pulse Generator (Non-Return-to-Zero Pulse Generator):

Converts the binary data from the PRBS generator into an optical-friendly pulse format.
NRZ encoding ensures a continuous signal without frequent resets.

3.CW Laser (Continuous Wave Laser):

Produces a continuous optical signal (laser light) as the carrier wave for data transmission.

4. Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM):

Modulates the CW laser signal with the data pulses (from the NRZ generator).
The MZM alters the amplitude or phase of the laser beam based on the input data signal.

5.Optical Amplifier:

Amplifies the modulated optical signal to ensure it reaches the desired power level for transmission.
Optical amplifiers help extend the communication range of the system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FSO Channel:
------------
- This represents the free-space medium (e.g., air or vacuum) where the optical signal propagates.
- External factors such as weather (fog, rain, dust) can attenuate the signal, impacting performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Receiver Side:
--------------
1. Optical Amplifier:

Amplifies the weak received optical signal to improve detection quality.
Photodetector:

Converts the received optical signal back into an electrical signal.
The photodetector detects the intensity of the light and regenerates the transmitted data.

2. Low Pass Filter:

Removes high-frequency noise and unwanted signal components, ensuring a clean electrical signal.

3.BER Analyzer (Bit Error Rate Analyzer):

Measures the performance of the communication system by calculating the number of errors in the received data.
A low BER indicates a reliable system.
